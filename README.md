# Pavementscapes
Pavementscapes is a pixel-wise database for pavement surface distress segmentation. The dataset descriptions, including the statistical analysis and deep learning baselines, has been pre-printed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00775.

Users can download the dataset by [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h9Mis8s93TrRfzWQ4tThi8D_Ze0qS25U?usp=sharing).

The mask_maker2.ipynb shows a demo how to make the TFrecords files for the dataset and use this dataset to train and test a deep neural networks.
